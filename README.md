# Age and Gender Classification

This project uses a pretrained ONNX model to classify the age and gender of every face detected in an image. All ONNX models are available in the `models` directory.

Follow the instructions below to run the server.

### Install dependencies

Run this in the root directory of the project:
```
poetry install
```

Activate the environment:
```
poetry env activate
```

### Start the server

Run this in the root directory of the project:
```
python -m age-and-gender-detection.server
```

Use [RescueBox-Desktop](https://github.com/UMass-Rescue/RescueBox-Desktop) to connect to the server and classify images.
